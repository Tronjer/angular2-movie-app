#### Release History
2016-04-18 v1.0.0 Initial release

##### Annotation
>  At this Beta Stage (April 2016) it's not yet possible to uglify & concatenate Angular 2 libs for production builds.
Hence I included all libaries by using system.js (didn't want webpack), which triggers some semantic Gulp errors.
